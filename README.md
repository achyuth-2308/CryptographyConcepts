# üîê Cryptography Concepts | Semester 6

Built as part of our **CS3002 - Cryptography Concepts** course, this repository includes fully functional **C implementations** of 15 classic cryptographic algorithms across different categories ‚Äî from simple monoalphabetic ciphers to complex transpositional systems.

Each algorithm comes with its own set of input/output examples, implementation logic, and is grouped for better understanding. Designed to be **technically informative**, **well-documented**, and **student-friendly**!

## üìÇ Categories of Ciphers

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Monoalphabetic Substitution
These algorithms replace each plaintext character with a unique ciphertext character.

| No. | Algorithm | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 1. | **Atbash Cipher** | A fixed-key cipher that mirrors the alphabet (A ‚Üî Z, B ‚Üî Y, ...). |
| 2. | **Caesar Cipher** | Shifts each letter by a fixed number (e.g., +3: A ‚Üí D). |
| 3. | **August Cipher** | Modified Caesar with a month-based shift. |
| 4. | **Affine Cipher** | Applies a linear function `E(x) = (ax + b) mod m`, with `a` and `b` as keys. |
| 5. | **Multiplicative Cipher** | A special case of affine where only multiplication is used (i.e., `b=0`). |

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Polyalphabetic Substitution
These ciphers use multiple substitution alphabets to obscure frequency analysis.

| No. | Algorithm | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 6. | **Vigen√®re Cipher** | Uses a repeated keyword to shift letters cyclically. |
| 7. | **Gronsfeld Cipher** | Variant of Vigen√®re using digits instead of letters for the key. |
| 8. | **Beaufort Cipher** | Similar to Vigen√®re but with reverse encryption logic. |
| 9. | **Autokey Cipher** | Appends plaintext to the key for dynamic shifting. |
| 10. | **Running Key Cipher** | Uses a longer key such as a book passage for encryption. |

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Polygraphic Substitution
These encrypt multiple characters at once, increasing complexity.

| No. | Algorithm | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 11. | **N-gram Splitting** | Preprocessing step for splitting plaintext into fixed-length chunks, often used in Hill Cipher. |
| 12. | **Hill Cipher** | Uses matrix multiplication over mod 26 to encrypt blocks of plaintext. Requires invertible key matrices. |

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Transpositional Ciphers
These rearrange the order of characters rather than substituting them.

| No. | Algorithm | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 13. | **Rail Fence Cipher** | Zig-zag pattern across rows and then concatenated row-wise. |
| 14. | **Route Cipher** | Fills a grid in a pattern and reads off ciphertext in a specified route. |
| 15. | **Myszkowski Cipher** | A transposition cipher that uses repeated-key digits to determine columnar reordering. |

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Utility Algorithms

- **N-Gram Splitting**: Used for preprocessing in the **Hill Cipher**, this splits text into uniform-length blocks (e.g., digraphs or trigraphs). Essential to maintain matrix size consistency in block ciphers.
